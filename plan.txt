Title
Prevalence of Residual Inflammatory Risk Among Statin-Treated U.S. Adults Achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL: A Nationally Representative NHANES Study

Background and Significance
Statins reduce LDL-C and cardiovascular events, yet a substantial proportion of patients maintain elevated inflammatory markers. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) independently predicts cardiovascular risk even after LDL-C is controlled. Contemporary trials consistently report that 30–40 percent of statin-treated patients have hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite adequate LDL-C reduction, and these patients experience higher event rates than those with elevated LDL-C alone. Nationally representative U.S. estimates for this specific “on-treatment residual inflammatory risk” group remain unknown.

Objectives
Primary: Estimate the weighted prevalence of residual inflammatory risk (RIR) among statin-treated adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL.
Secondary:
• Compare demographic and clinical characteristics between statin users with vs without RIR.
• Evaluate alternative definitions (hs-CRP ≥3 mg/L; LDL-C <55 mg/dL).
• Identify predictors of RIR using survey-weighted regression.

Data Source
NHANES cycles with complete data on lipids, hs-CRP, prescription medications, and fasting labs. Use appropriate examination weights, strata, and clustering for all analyses.

Population
Inclusion: Adults ≥20 years with
• self-reported statin use (identified from medication files),
• fasting LDL-C measured,
• hs-CRP measured.
Exclusion:
• hs-CRP >10 mg/L,
• missing key variables.

Primary analytic cohort: Statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL.

Key Variables
• Statin use: from prescription files.
• LDL-C: fasting subsample.
• hs-CRP: mg/L.
• Covariates: age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, triglycerides, HDL-C.

Definition of RIR
Primary: statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L.
Sensitivity:
• hs-CRP ≥3 mg/L,
• LDL-C <55 mg/dL,
• exclusion of hs-CRP >10 mg/L.

Statistical Plan
• Compute weighted prevalence of RIR overall and by subgroups.
• Compare characteristics using survey-adjusted t-tests and chi-square tests.
• Fit survey-weighted logistic regression to identify predictors of RIR.
• Conduct stratified and sensitivity analyses using alternative thresholds.

Expected Contribution
This study fills a national-level knowledge gap on the burden of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C. Findings can inform population-level risk stratification and support clinical pathways targeting inflammation as a secondary therapeutic goal.
