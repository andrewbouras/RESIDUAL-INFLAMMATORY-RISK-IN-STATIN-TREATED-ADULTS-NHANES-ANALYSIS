# RIR Study: Results Summary

## Study Overview
**Title:** Prevalence of Residual Inflammatory Risk Among Statin-Treated U.S. Adults Achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL

**Data Source:** NHANES 2005-2010, 2015-2020 (Note: 2011-2014 excluded due to missing hs-CRP data)

---

## Key Findings

### Primary Result
**Weighted RIR Prevalence: 39.3% (95% CI: 32.4%-46.1%)**

Among statin-treated U.S. adults who achieved guideline-recommended LDL-C <70 mg/dL, approximately **4 in 10** still have residual inflammatory risk (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L).

### Sample Size
- Total eligible participants: 12,089
- Statin users: 2,392
- Primary cohort (statin + LDL <70): 550
- RIR cases (hs-CRP ≥2): 224

## Table 1: Key Characteristics by RIR Status

| Characteristic | No RIR | RIR | p-value |
|---------------|--------|-----|---------|
| Age (years) | 66.0 ± 12.1 | 66.1 ± 11.1 | 0.97 |
| Female (%) | 36.6 | 43.6 | 0.25 |
| **BMI (kg/m²)** | **29.1 ± 5.6** | **32.4 ± 7.5** | **0.001** |
| **Obesity (%)** | **40.2** | **57.4** | **0.03** |
| Hypertension (%) | 75.1 | 84.0 | 0.11 |
| Diabetes (%) | 47.1 | 58.8 | 0.12 |
| CVD history (%) | 45.6 | 50.1 | 0.42 |
| **hs-CRP (mg/L)** | **0.89 ± 0.51** | **4.23 ± 1.86** | **<0.001** |

**Key difference:** BMI and obesity are significantly higher in the RIR group.

## Table 2: RIR Prevalence by Subgroups

| Subgroup | Prevalence (95% CI) |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Overall** | **39.3% (32.4-46.1%)** |
| | |
| **Age** | |
| 20-44 | 27.8% (0.3-55.4%) |
| 45-64 | 44.6% (34.3-54.8%) |
| ≥65 | 37.0% (29.0-44.9%) |
| | |
| **Sex** | |
| Male | 36.5% (28.7-44.4%) |
| Female | 43.5% (33.1-53.8%) |
| | |
| **Obesity** | |
| Non-obese | ~30% |
| Obese | ~50% |

## Table 3: Predictors of RIR (Adjusted OR)

| Predictor | OR (95% CI) | p-value |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **BMI (per kg/m²)** | **1.07 (1.02-1.13)** | **0.006** |
| CVD history | 1.42 (0.88-2.29) | 0.14 |
| Diabetes | 1.34 (0.71-2.53) | 0.36 |
| Female sex | 1.26 (0.69-2.31) | 0.44 |
| Current smoker | 1.42 (0.51-3.98) | 0.49 |

**Key finding:** BMI is the only significant independent predictor of RIR (OR 1.07 per unit, p=0.006).

## Sensitivity Analyses

| Analysis | Prevalence (95% CI) |
|----------|---------------------|
| Primary (hs-CRP ≥2) | 39.3% (32.4-46.1%) |
| Stricter (hs-CRP ≥3) | 25.5% (19.3-31.6%) |
| LDL <55 cohort | 46.5% (35.4-57.6%) |
| ASCVD subgroup | 41.5% (32.6-50.4%) |

## Clinical Implications

1. **High prevalence:** ~40% of statin-treated patients with optimal LDL still have elevated inflammation
2. **Obesity-inflammation link:** BMI is the strongest modifiable predictor of RIR
3. **Therapeutic opportunity:** These patients may benefit from:
   - Weight loss interventions
   - Anti-inflammatory therapies (e.g., colchicine, icosapent ethyl)
   - Lifestyle modifications targeting inflammation

## Technical Notes

- **CRP unit harmonization:** 2005-2010 cycles used LBXCRP (mg/dL), converted to mg/L to match 2015-2020 LBXHSCRP
- **Survey weights:** WTSAF2YR (fasting subsample) adjusted for pooled cycles
- **Survey design:** Accounted for PSU, strata, and singleton PSU adjustment
