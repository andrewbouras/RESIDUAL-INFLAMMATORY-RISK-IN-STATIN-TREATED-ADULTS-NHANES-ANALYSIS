RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK IN STATIN-TREATED ADULTS: NHANES ANALYSIS

Preliminary Results Summary (Updated)
December 2025


OVERVIEW

This analysis estimates the prevalence of residual inflammatory risk (RIR) among statin-treated US adults who have achieved guideline-recommended LDL-C levels. RIR is defined as persistent elevation of hs-CRP (≥2 mg/L) despite statin therapy and LDL-C control (<70 mg/dL).

Per PI request, this update includes: (1) 6-group LDL × statin stratification, (2) diabetes/prediabetes evaluation, and (3) sex-stratified analyses.


METHODS

Data Source and Population

We used NHANES data from 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, representing five two-year survey cycles. The 2011-2014 cycles were not included due to data access constraints; inclusion is planned as a robustness check.

The analytic sample included 12,896 fasting adults aged 20+ years with complete data on statin use, lipids, and hs-CRP. We excluded individuals with hs-CRP >10 mg/L.

Variable Definitions

- Statin use: Identified from RXQ_RX using drug names and Multum therapeutic class codes.
- LDL-C: Calculated via Friedewald equation.
- Prediabetes: HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL.
- Diabetes: HbA1c ≥6.5% or fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL or self-reported diagnosis.
- RIR: Statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L.


STUDY POPULATION

Total fasting participants (≥20 years): 12,896
Statin users: 2,527 (19.6%)
Statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL: 577
RIR cases: 141


PRIMARY RESULTS

RIR Prevalence (Statin users with LDL-C <70)

- Primary (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L): 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9-27.9%)

- Stricter LDL <55 mg/dL (N=213): 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0-36.8%)

KEY FINDINGS

1. Primary finding remains robust: ~22% of statin-treated adults with LDL<70 have RIR.

2. 6-group analysis shows statin users have higher hs-CRP prevalence than non-users within each LDL tier, suggesting statins may be preferentially prescribed to higher-risk individuals or that statin use alone does not fully address inflammatory risk.

3. LDL≤70 without statins shows 14.5% with elevated hs-CRP, supporting the existence of a "low LDL, high inflammation" phenotype independent of statin use.

4. Diabetes/prediabetes strongly associated with elevated hs-CRP across all groups, with diabetics showing roughly double the hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence of normoglycemics.

5. Sex differences exist: women show higher inflammatory burden in non-statin groups; BMI and age are significant predictors of RIR in women but not men.


LIMITATIONS

1. Cross-sectional design precludes causal inference
2. hs-CRP measured once; repeated measurements would reduce misclassification
3. Subgroup analyses are exploratory and not powered for formal comparisons
4. 2011-2014 cycles not yet incorporated
5. Statin adherence not directly measured
