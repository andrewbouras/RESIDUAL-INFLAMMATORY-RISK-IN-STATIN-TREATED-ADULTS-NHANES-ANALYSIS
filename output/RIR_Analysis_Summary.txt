RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK IN STATIN-TREATED ADULTS: NHANES ANALYSIS

Preliminary Results Summary
December 2024


OVERVIEW

This analysis estimates the prevalence of residual inflammatory risk (RIR) among statin-treated US adults who have achieved guideline-recommended LDL-C levels. RIR is defined as persistent elevation of hs-CRP (≥2 mg/L) despite statin therapy and LDL-C control (<70 mg/dL).


METHODS

Data Source and Population

We used NHANES data from 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, representing five two-year survey cycles. The 2011-2014 cycles were not included in this initial analysis due to data access constraints in our automated pipeline; we plan to incorporate them in a future robustness check.

The analytic sample included fasting adults aged 20 years and older with complete data on statin use, lipid panel, and hs-CRP. We excluded individuals with hs-CRP >10 mg/L to remove acute inflammatory states.

Variable Definitions

Statin use was identified from prescription medication files (RXQ_RX) using both generic drug name matching (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin) and Multum therapeutic class codes.

LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation (total cholesterol minus HDL minus triglycerides/5). Direct LDL measurements were used as a secondary source when calculated values were unavailable and triglycerides were below 400 mg/dL.

RIR was defined as: statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L.

Statistical Approach

All analyses incorporated NHANES complex survey design using fasting subsample weights, strata, and primary sampling units. Prevalence estimates are survey-weighted and nationally representative. Logistic regression models used a parsimonious approach given the sample size.


STUDY POPULATION

Starting with 12,896 fasting adults aged 20 and older across the included cycles, we identified 2,527 statin users (19.6%). Among these, 577 had achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, constituting our primary analytic cohort. Of these 577 individuals, 141 met criteria for RIR.


PRIMARY RESULTS

RIR Prevalence

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9-27.9%) had residual inflammatory risk. Using a stricter hs-CRP threshold of ≥3 mg/L, prevalence was 13.4% (95% CI: 8.8-18.0%).

Among the subset achieving LDL-C <55 mg/dL (n=213), RIR prevalence was 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0-36.8%).

Subgroup Patterns

RIR prevalence appeared similar between men (23.7%, SE 3.5%) and women (19.2%, SE 4.5%).

By age group, prevalence was numerically highest in the 50-59 year range (46.8%, SE 9.9%), though this estimate carries substantial uncertainty due to limited sample size.

By race/ethnicity, prevalence ranged from 20.4% (SE 3.9%) in Non-Hispanic White adults to 29.4% (SE 4.6%) in Non-Hispanic Black adults. These subgroup estimates are exploratory and confidence intervals overlap considerably.

Clinical Characteristics

Compared to statin users with LDL-C <70 but without RIR, those with RIR had higher prevalence of diabetes (64.6% vs 51.1%), hypertension (87.9% vs 76.8%), obesity (53.5% vs 45.8%), and current smoking (17.7% vs 13.2%).

Predictors of RIR

In survey-weighted logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and triglycerides, no individual predictor reached statistical significance at alpha=0.05. BMI showed a trend toward association with higher RIR odds (OR 1.05 per kg/m², 95% CI 1.00-1.11, p=0.055).


SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

RIR prevalence showed a clear dose-response pattern across hs-CRP thresholds: 29.6% at ≥1.5 mg/L, declining to 6.4% at ≥5.0 mg/L.

RIR prevalence remained relatively stable across LDL-C thresholds (range 20.7-26.9% from <100 to <55 mg/dL), suggesting that residual inflammation persists even as lipid control intensifies.


DEVIATIONS FROM ORIGINAL PLAN

The analysis was conducted as planned with the following modifications:

1. Cycle inclusion: We used 2005-2020 as recommended, but the 2011-2014 cycles were excluded from this initial pass due to hs-CRP file access issues in the automated download. Five cycles (10 years of data) were analyzed.

2. LDL-C calculation: Friedewald equation used as primary, with direct LDL as fallback when calculated values were missing and triglycerides <400 mg/dL, as specified.

3. Statistical testing: Formal chi-square tests comparing RIR vs non-RIR groups were not performed in this initial analysis; descriptive comparisons are presented. Subgroup interaction tests were not powered.


LIMITATIONS

This is a cross-sectional analysis and cannot establish causality. hs-CRP was measured once, so within-person variability is not captured. The regression model has limited power given 141 RIR events among 577 subjects. Statin adherence is based on self-report.


INTERPRETATION

Approximately one in five statin-treated US adults who achieve LDL-C <70 mg/dL have persistent inflammatory risk as defined by hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. This finding is consistent with trial data suggesting 30-40% of statin-treated patients maintain elevated hs-CRP. The slightly lower prevalence in NHANES may reflect the stricter LDL threshold (<70 vs <100 mg/dL in many trials) or population differences.

These results support the rationale for identifying and potentially targeting residual inflammatory risk in patients with well-controlled lipids.
