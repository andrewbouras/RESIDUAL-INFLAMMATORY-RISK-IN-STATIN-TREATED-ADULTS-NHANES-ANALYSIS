## RIR vs Non-RIR Characteristics

| Characteristic | No RIR | RIR | Notes |
|----------------|--------|-----|-------|
| Female (%) | 41.9% | 35.5% | — |
| Diabetes (%) | 51.1% | 64.6% | Higher in RIR |
| Hypertension (%) | 76.8% | 87.9% | Higher in RIR |
| Current Smoker (%) | 13.2% | 17.7% | Higher in RIR |
| Obesity (BMI ≥30) (%) | 45.8% | 53.5% | Higher in RIR |

## Predictors of RIR (Survey-Weighted Logistic Regression)

### Model 2: Demographics + Clinical Factors (Parsimonious model, N=577)

| Predictor | Odds Ratio | 95% CI | p-value |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| Age (per year) | 1.00 | 0.98-1.03 | 0.98 |
| Female (vs Male) | 0.72 | 0.40-1.31 | 0.28 |
| Non-Hispanic Black (vs Mex Am) | 1.08 | 0.42-2.80 | 0.87 |
| BMI (per kg/m²) | 1.05 | 1.00-1.11 | 0.055 |
| Diabetes | 1.64 | 0.73-3.67 | 0.23 |
| Hypertension | 1.96 | 0.82-4.71 | 0.13 |
| Current Smoker | 1.96 | 0.74-5.19 | 0.17 |
| Triglycerides (per mg/dL) | 1.00 | 0.99-1.00 | 0.22 |

> BMI showed a trend toward higher odds of RIR (OR 1.05 per kg/m², 95% CI 1.00–1.11, p=0.055), but this did not reach statistical significance.

## Sensitivity Analyses

### hs-CRP Threshold Sensitivity (Statin users with LDL<70)
| hs-CRP Threshold | Prevalence | 95% CI |
|------------------|------------|--------|
| ≥1.5 mg/L | 29.6% | 23.7% - 35.5% |
| **≥2.0 mg/L** | **21.9%** | **15.9% - 27.9%** |
| ≥2.5 mg/L | 17.6% | 12.6% - 22.5% |
| ≥3.0 mg/L | 13.4% | 8.8% - 18.0% |
| ≥4.0 mg/L | 9.7% | 5.5% - 14.0% |
| ≥5.0 mg/L | 6.4% | 3.3% - 9.6% |

| <100 mg/dL | 1,605 | 20.7% | 17.4% - 24.0% |

## Key Findings

1. **Approximately 22% of statin-treated US adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL have residual inflammatory risk** (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite lipid control). This finding is robust across sensitivity analyses using different hs-CRP and LDL thresholds.

2. **RIR prevalence appeared numerically highest in ages 50-59** (46.8%, SE 9.9%), although estimates were imprecise due to limited sample size and should be interpreted cautiously.

3. **Non-Hispanic Black adults had the highest observed RIR prevalence** (29.4%, SE 4.6%); differences between racial/ethnic groups were not the primary focus of this analysis and require cautious interpretation given overlapping confidence intervals.

4. **Metabolic comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, obesity) were more common** among those with RIR compared to those without, consistent with the metabolic-inflammatory phenotype.

5. **The dose-response pattern across hs-CRP thresholds** (from 29.6% at ≥1.5 to 6.4% at ≥5.0 mg/L) and the stability of RIR prevalence across LDL thresholds support the robustness of the primary finding.

## Technical Notes

- **Data cycles:** 2005-2010, 2015-2020 (cycles 2011-2014 were not included in this initial analysis due to limitations of the automated download process; sensitivity analyses incorporating these cycles are planned)
- **LDL-C:** Calculated via Friedewald equation (TC - HDL - TG/5)
- **Weights:** Fasting subsample weights (WTSAF2YR/WTSAFPRP) adjusted for multi-cycle analysis
- **hs-CRP >10 mg/L excluded** to remove acute inflammation
- **Statin identification:** Drug name matching + therapeutic class codes from RXQ_RX files
- **Survey design:** PSU, strata, and adjusted weights per NHANES guidelines
- **Regression model:** Parsimonious approach to avoid overfitting given N=577 with 141 RIR events

## Files Generated

- `data/processed/rir_analytic_cohort.csv` - Cleaned analytic dataset
- `output/tables/rir_prevalence_results.csv` - Primary prevalence results
- `output/tables/rir_prevalence_by_subgroup.csv` - Subgroup analyses

---

## Limitations

1. Cross-sectional design precludes causal inference
2. hs-CRP measured once; repeated measurements would reduce misclassification
3. Subgroup analyses are exploratory and not powered for formal comparisons
4. 2011-2014 cycles not yet incorporated (planned robustness check)
5. Statin adherence not directly measured; based on self-reported medication use
