ABSTRACT
================================================================================

BACKGROUND: Despite achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 
goals with statin therapy, many patients retain elevated cardiovascular risk 
attributed to residual inflammatory risk (RIR). The prevalence and predictors 
of RIR in the U.S. population, and its association with mortality, remain 
incompletely characterized.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and predictors of RIR among statin-
treated U.S. adults with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and to evaluate the association 
between elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and mortality 
in statin users.

METHODS: Using NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2016 with linked mortality data, we 
identified statin users aged ≥20 years from the fasting subsample. RIR was 
defined as statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. We assessed RIR 
prevalence by subgroups using survey-weighted estimates and identified 
predictors using logistic regression. Mortality was analyzed using Cox 
proportional hazards models among all statin users.

RESULTS: Among 2,527 statin users, 577 (22.8%) had LDL-C <70 mg/dL. Of these, 
141 (24.4%) had RIR (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L). RIR prevalence was higher in women 
(32.1% vs 19.2%), those with obesity (34.8% vs 15.3%), and those with diabetes 
(29.4% vs 20.8%). Among 1,714 statin users with mortality follow-up (mean 
8.3 years), 488 deaths occurred. Elevated hs-CRP (≥2 vs <2 mg/L) was 
associated with 49% higher all-cause mortality (HR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.03-2.15; 
p=0.032) and 54% higher cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.54; 95% CI: 0.86-2.74; 
p=0.14) after adjustment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Each 1 mg/L 
increase in hs-CRP was associated with 14% higher mortality (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 
1.07-1.21; p<0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-quarter of statin-treated adults with LDL-C <70 mg/dL 
have residual inflammatory risk. Elevated hs-CRP is associated with 
significantly higher mortality among statin users, supporting the clinical 
relevance of addressing inflammation beyond LDL-C lowering.

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Statin therapy has transformed cardiovascular disease prevention by 
dramatically lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and 
reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (1). Contemporary guidelines 
recommend intensive LDL-C lowering to targets of <70 mg/dL for high-risk 
patients and <55 mg/dL for very high-risk patients (2,3). However, even 
with optimal LDL-C control, substantial residual cardiovascular risk 
persists (4,5).

The concept of "residual inflammatory risk" has emerged as a key framework 
for understanding this persistent risk (6). High-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation, independently predicts 
cardiovascular events even after adjustment for LDL-C and other traditional 
risk factors (7). The landmark CANTOS trial demonstrated that targeting 
inflammation with canakinumab, an interleukin-1β inhibitor, reduced 
cardiovascular events independently of lipid lowering, establishing 
proof-of-concept for anti-inflammatory therapy in cardiovascular prevention (8).

Residual inflammatory risk is typically defined as elevated hs-CRP (≥2 mg/L) 
despite statin therapy and controlled LDL-C (9). Understanding the prevalence 
and determinants of RIR in the general population is essential for identifying 
patients who might benefit from emerging anti-inflammatory therapies such as 
colchicine, which has shown benefit in the COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trials (10,11).

We sought to characterize RIR in the U.S. population using NHANES data by:
(1) determining the prevalence of RIR among statin-treated adults with 
LDL-C <70 mg/dL; (2) identifying demographic and clinical predictors of RIR; 
and (3) evaluating the association between elevated hs-CRP and mortality 
among statin users.

================================================================================
METHODS
================================================================================

DATA SOURCE AND STUDY POPULATION

This analysis used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative survey of the civilian, 
non-institutionalized U.S. population (12). We combined data from NHANES 
cycles 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2015-2016. The 2011-2014 cycles 
were excluded due to the use of a different CRP assay that precluded 
harmonization with hs-CRP measurements.

The analytic sample included adults aged ≥20 years from the fasting 
subsample (required for LDL-C calculation) with complete data for hs-CRP, 
lipid measurements, and statin use. Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L were 
excluded to focus on chronic inflammation rather than acute infectious or 
inflammatory conditions (13).

STATIN IDENTIFICATION

Statin use was identified from the prescription medication questionnaire 
(RXQ_RX). Participants were classified as statin users if they reported 
current use of any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, including atorvastatin, 
fluvastatin, lovastatin, pitavastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or 
simvastatin. Combination products containing a statin component were 
also included.

LDL CHOLESTEROL CALCULATION

LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation: LDL-C = Total Cholesterol 
- HDL-C - (Triglycerides/5), applicable when triglycerides were <400 mg/dL. 
Fasting samples were required for valid LDL-C estimation.

RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK DEFINITION

RIR was defined as the combination of:
• Current statin use
• LDL-C <70 mg/dL
• hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L

This definition follows the conceptual framework established in post-hoc 
analyses of the JUPITER and PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trials, which identified 
hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L as a threshold associated with increased cardiovascular 
risk despite statin therapy (9,14).

MORTALITY OUTCOMES

Mortality data were obtained from the NHANES Public-Use Linked Mortality 
Files, which link survey participants to the National Death Index through 
December 31, 2019 (15). Outcomes included all-cause mortality and 
cardiovascular mortality (underlying cause of death codes for heart disease 
or cerebrovascular disease).

COVARIATES

Demographic variables included age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Clinical 
covariates included body mass index (BMI), obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), diabetes 
(HbA1c ≥6.5%, self-reported diabetes, or diabetes medication use), 
hypertension (average SBP ≥130 mmHg, DBP ≥80 mmHg, or antihypertensive 
medication use), and current smoking status.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All analyses incorporated NHANES survey weights, strata, and primary sampling 
units. Fasting sample weights were used for lipid-related analyses and scaled 
for combined cycles per NCHS guidelines.

Prevalence estimates with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for RIR 
overall and by demographic/clinical subgroups. Predictors of RIR were 
evaluated using survey-weighted logistic regression.

Mortality analyses included all statin users with linked mortality data. 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) 
for mortality associated with elevated hs-CRP. Models were adjusted for 
age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Follow-up time was calculated from examination 
date to death or censoring (December 31, 2019).

Analyses were performed using R version 4.3 with the survey and survival 
packages.

================================================================================
RESULTS
================================================================================

STUDY POPULATION

Among 12,896 fasting subsample participants with complete data, 2,527 
(19.6%) were current statin users. Of the statin users, 577 (22.8%) had 
achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, representing the primary cohort for RIR analysis.

Characteristics of statin users are shown in Table 1. Mean age was 62.4 
years, 48.7% were female, and mean LDL-C was 97.3 mg/dL. Among those with 
LDL-C <70 mg/dL, mean hs-CRP was 2.1 mg/L.

PREVALENCE OF RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK

Among the 577 statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, 141 (24.4%) met criteria 
for RIR (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L). The remaining 436 (75.6%) had achieved both 
lipid and inflammatory control (LDL-C <70 and hs-CRP <2).

RIR PREVALENCE BY SUBGROUPS (TABLE 2)

RIR prevalence varied significantly by demographic and clinical factors:

Sex:
• Women: 32.1% (95% CI: 24.8-40.5%)
• Men: 19.2% (95% CI: 13.7-26.2%)
• P = 0.008

Obesity:
• Obese (BMI ≥30): 34.8% (95% CI: 27.1-43.4%)
• Non-obese: 15.3% (95% CI: 10.2-22.2%)
• P < 0.001

Diabetes:
• Diabetic: 29.4% (95% CI: 22.0-38.1%)
• Non-diabetic: 20.8% (95% CI: 14.4-29.0%)
• P = 0.09

Age:
• Age <65: 27.8% (95% CI: 20.5-36.5%)
• Age ≥65: 21.3% (95% CI: 15.4-28.6%)
• P = 0.16

Race/Ethnicity:
• Non-Hispanic White: 23.2%
• Non-Hispanic Black: 29.4%
• Hispanic: 26.7%
• P = 0.34

PREDICTORS OF RIR (TABLE 3)

In multivariable logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
and comorbidities, independent predictors of RIR included:

• Female sex: OR 1.82 (95% CI: 1.11-2.98), p=0.02
• Obesity: OR 2.54 (95% CI: 1.52-4.25), p<0.001
• Diabetes: OR 1.38 (95% CI: 0.84-2.26), p=0.21 (not significant)
• Current smoking: OR 1.76 (95% CI: 0.92-3.37), p=0.09 (not significant)

MORTALITY ANALYSIS

Among 1,714 statin users with linked mortality data (from cycles 2005-2010 
and 2015-2016), 488 deaths (28.5%) occurred over a mean follow-up of 
8.3 years, including 174 cardiovascular deaths.

hs-CRP and All-Cause Mortality (Table 4):

Continuous hs-CRP:
• HR per 1 mg/L increase: 1.14 (95% CI: 1.07-1.21), p<0.001

hs-CRP Categories:
• <1 mg/L: Reference
• 1-2 mg/L: HR 1.47 (95% CI: 1.08-2.00), p=0.01
• ≥2 mg/L: HR 1.56 (95% CI: 1.08-2.26), p=0.02
• P-trend < 0.001

Binary hs-CRP (≥2 vs <2 mg/L):
• HR: 1.49 (95% CI: 1.03-2.15), p=0.032

hs-CRP and Cardiovascular Mortality:

Binary hs-CRP (≥2 vs <2 mg/L):
• HR: 1.54 (95% CI: 0.86-2.74), p=0.14

The cardiovascular mortality finding was directionally consistent but did 
not reach statistical significance, likely reflecting limited events 
(n=174 CV deaths).

RIR-SPECIFIC MORTALITY (EXPLORATORY)

Among the 343 participants in the RIR primary cohort (statin + LDL <70) 
with mortality linkage, 146 deaths occurred. RIR (vs no RIR) was associated 
with a trend toward higher mortality:
• HR: 1.80 (95% CI: 0.93-3.49), p=0.08

This analysis was limited by small sample size (46 RIR cases, 14 deaths) 
and should be considered exploratory.

================================================================================
DISCUSSION
================================================================================

In this nationally representative analysis of U.S. adults, we found that 
nearly one-quarter (24.4%) of statin-treated patients with LDL-C <70 mg/dL 
have residual inflammatory risk, defined as hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. RIR was more 
prevalent in women and those with obesity. Importantly, elevated hs-CRP 
was associated with significantly higher all-cause mortality among statin 
users, with each 1 mg/L increase conferring 14% higher risk.

PREVALENCE AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

Our finding that approximately one-quarter of statin-treated patients with 
controlled LDL-C retain elevated inflammation is consistent with prior 
estimates from clinical trial populations. In PROVE IT-TIMI 22, 
approximately 40% of patients achieved both LDL-C <70 and hs-CRP <2 after 
atorvastatin 80 mg, leaving 60% with residual lipid or inflammatory risk (14). 
The lower RIR prevalence in our study may reflect the population-based 
sample versus high-risk trial participants.

These findings have important therapeutic implications. The FDA approval 
of low-dose colchicine (Lodoco) for cardiovascular risk reduction, based 
on COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trial data, provides a targeted intervention for 
patients with residual inflammatory risk (10,11). Our results suggest 
that a substantial proportion of statin-treated Americans might be 
candidates for such therapy.

PREDICTORS OF RIR

The strong association between obesity and RIR (OR 2.54) is biologically 
plausible. Adipose tissue is metabolically active and secretes 
pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6, the primary driver 
of hepatic CRP production (16). This finding suggests that weight 
management may be an important adjunct to pharmacotherapy for reducing 
inflammatory risk.

The higher RIR prevalence in women aligns with known sex differences in 
inflammation and cardiovascular risk (17). Whether this reflects hormonal 
factors, differences in adipose distribution, or other mechanisms warrants 
further investigation.

MORTALITY IMPLICATIONS

The association between elevated hs-CRP and mortality in statin-treated 
patients underscores the clinical relevance of residual inflammatory risk. 
The 49% higher all-cause mortality associated with hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L is 
substantial and persisted after adjustment for demographics.

This finding extends prior observations from JUPITER and PROVE IT-TIMI 22 
to a general population sample and longer follow-up. In JUPITER, patients 
achieving hs-CRP <2 mg/L on rosuvastatin had significantly lower event 
rates than those remaining above this threshold (9). Our results suggest 
this relationship translates to mortality in real-world practice.

COMPARISON WITH GUIDELINES

Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend consideration of hs-CRP as a "risk 
enhancer" to inform statin initiation decisions in intermediate-risk 
patients (18). However, there is less guidance on monitoring hs-CRP 
on-treatment or targeting anti-inflammatory therapy based on residual 
inflammation. Our findings, combined with emerging trial evidence, 
support a more systematic approach to identifying and treating patients 
with RIR.

LIMITATIONS

Several limitations merit consideration. First, NHANES captures a single 
hs-CRP measurement, which may be affected by acute illness. We excluded 
values >10 mg/L, but subclinical infection could contribute to elevated 
hs-CRP in some participants.

Second, statin use was self-reported and we could not verify adherence or 
statin intensity. Some patients classified as having LDL-C <70 may not 
have been on maximally tolerated therapy.

Third, the 2011-2014 NHANES cycles were excluded due to CRP assay 
differences, reducing sample size and temporal coverage.

Fourth, mortality linkage extended only through 2019, limiting follow-up 
for more recent cycles. The RIR-specific mortality analysis was 
underpowered due to few events in this subgroup.

Fifth, we could not assess incident cardiovascular events, only mortality. 
Non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke are important outcomes that 
could not be evaluated.

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

Among statin-treated U.S. adults who have achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, 
approximately one-quarter have residual inflammatory risk defined by 
hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. RIR is more prevalent in women and those with obesity. 
Elevated hs-CRP is associated with significantly higher mortality in 
statin users, supporting the clinical relevance of addressing inflammation 
beyond LDL-C lowering.

These findings provide population-based evidence supporting the emerging 
paradigm of targeting inflammation in cardiovascular prevention and 
suggest a substantial treatment-eligible population for anti-inflammatory 
therapies such as colchicine.

================================================================================
PERSPECTIVES
================================================================================

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Residual inflammatory risk, defined as 
hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy and LDL-C <70 mg/dL, affects 
approximately one-quarter of optimally treated patients and is associated 
with increased mortality.

COMPETENCY IN PATIENT CARE: Clinicians should consider measuring hs-CRP 
in statin-treated patients with controlled LDL-C to identify those with 
residual inflammatory risk who might benefit from additional interventions 
including weight management and potentially anti-inflammatory therapy.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: With FDA approval of colchicine for cardiovascular 
risk reduction, practical algorithms for identifying and treating RIR 
in clinical practice are needed. Cost-effectiveness analyses comparing 
strategies for RIR identification and treatment will inform 
implementation.
