# RESULTS

## STUDY POPULATION

From NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, a total of 12,896 fasting adults aged ≥20 years with hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included in the analysis (**Supplemental Table 1**). Among these, 2,527 (19.6% weighted) reported current statin use. Of the statin users, 577 (22.8% of statin users) had achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, representing the primary analytic cohort. Within this cohort, 141 participants met criteria for residual inflammatory risk (statin use + LDL-C <70 + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L).

Baseline characteristics of statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL stratified by RIR status are presented in **Table 1**. The mean age was similar between groups (66.2 vs 65.4 years, p=0.64). Participants with RIR had significantly higher BMI (32.4 vs 29.8 kg/m², p=0.039), higher HbA1c (6.9% vs 6.2%, p=0.032), and higher prevalence of hypertension (87.9% vs 76.8%, p=0.042). hs-CRP was markedly higher in the RIR group by definition (4.1 vs 0.6 mg/L, p<0.001). Diabetes prevalence was numerically higher in the RIR group (64.6% vs 51.1%) but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.19).

## PRIMARY OUTCOME: RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK PREVALENCE

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (n=577), the survey-weighted prevalence of RIR (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L) was **21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%)**. Using the more stringent hs-CRP threshold of ≥3 mg/L, RIR prevalence was 13.4% (95% CI: 8.8%-18.0%).

Among the subset of statin users achieving the more aggressive LDL-C target of <55 mg/dL (n=213), RIR prevalence was higher at 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0%-36.8%), suggesting that even patients achieving very low LDL-C levels maintain substantial inflammatory burden.

### Subgroup Prevalence

RIR prevalence varied by demographic and clinical subgroups within the primary cohort:

**By sex:** Males showed numerically higher RIR prevalence than females (23.7%, SE 3.5% vs 19.2%, SE 4.5%), though confidence intervals overlapped.

**By age group:** RIR prevalence appeared highest in the 50-59 age group (46.8%, SE 9.9%), though this estimate has high imprecision due to limited sample size and should be interpreted cautiously. Prevalence in other age groups ranged from 2.7% (20-39 years) to 22.7% (60-69 years).

**By race/ethnicity:** Non-Hispanic Black participants had the highest observed RIR prevalence (29.4%, SE 4.6%), followed by Other Hispanic (29.1%, SE 7.3%), Other/Multi-racial (24.2%, SE 8.4%), Mexican American (23.5%, SE 6.5%), and Non-Hispanic White (20.4%, SE 3.9%). These differences were not the primary focus of this analysis and require cautious interpretation given overlapping confidence intervals.

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: 6-GROUP LDL×STATIN STRATIFICATION

To understand inflammatory burden across the spectrum of LDL-C control and statin treatment, hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence was examined across six mutually exclusive LDL×statin groups (**Table 2**, **Figure 1**).

Within each LDL-C tier, statin users consistently showed higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users:
- **LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL:** Statin users 22.4% (SE 3.0%) vs non-users 14.5% (SE 2.0%)
- **LDL-C 70-130 mg/dL:** Statin users 20.1% (SE 1.8%) vs non-users 17.7% (SE 0.8%)
- **LDL-C >130 mg/dL:** Statin users 27.0% (SE 4.6%) vs non-users 19.8% (SE 1.3%)

Notably, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L, representing individuals with low LDL-C and elevated inflammation in the absence of statin therapy. This pattern may reflect underlying metabolic-inflammatory status rather than a distinct clinical phenotype and requires confirmation in longitudinal studies.

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: GLYCEMIC STATUS STRATIFICATION

RIR prevalence was examined by glycemic status among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (**Figure 2**):
- **Normal glycemia (n=47):** 15.3% (SE 9.3%) — *Note: This estimate has high imprecision due to limited sample size*
- **Prediabetes (n=180):** 17.4% (SE 5.2%)
- **Diabetes (n=350):** 26.2% (SE 4.8%)

The pattern of increasing RIR prevalence with worsening glycemic status was consistent across all six LDL×statin groups (**Table 2B**). Among diabetics, hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence ranged from 26.2% (LDL≤70, statin) to 33.6% (LDL 70-130, no statin), compared to 9.3%-20.4% among those with normal glycemia.

## EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: SEX DIFFERENCES

Sex-stratified analysis of hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence across LDL×statin groups revealed consistent patterns of higher inflammatory burden in women among non-statin users (**Figure 3**, **Table 2C**):

- **LDL ≤70, no statin:** Females 18.3% (SE 2.7%) vs Males 9.7% (SE 2.0%)
- **LDL 70-130, no statin:** Females 20.2% (SE 1.1%) vs Males 14.9% (SE 0.9%)
- **LDL >130, statin:** Females 32.0% (SE 5.9%) vs Males 20.4% (SE 4.9%)

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, sex-specific regression models revealed differential predictors of RIR. In women, BMI (OR 1.07 per kg/m², 95% CI: 1.01-1.14, p=0.02) and age (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08, p=0.04) were significant predictors of RIR. In men, neither BMI (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.93-1.14) nor age (OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.96-1.01) was significantly associated with RIR.

## PREDICTORS OF RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK

In the full cohort of statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, survey-weighted logistic regression was used to identify predictors of RIR (**Table 3**). A parsimonious model including demographics and clinical factors was fit to avoid overfitting.

No individual predictor achieved statistical significance at p<0.05. BMI showed a trend toward higher odds of RIR (OR 1.05 per kg/m², 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, p=0.055). Diabetes (OR 1.64, 95% CI: 0.73-3.67, p=0.23), hypertension (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 0.82-4.71, p=0.13), and current smoking (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 0.74-5.19, p=0.17) showed elevated point estimates but did not reach statistical significance. Regression analyses are limited by sample size (N=577 with 141 RIR events) and are underpowered for detecting small effect sizes.

## SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the primary findings (**Supplemental Table 2**).

**hs-CRP threshold sensitivity.** Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, RIR prevalence showed a clear dose-response pattern across hs-CRP thresholds:
- ≥1.5 mg/L: 29.6% (95% CI: 23.7%-35.5%)
- ≥2.0 mg/L: 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%)
- ≥2.5 mg/L: 17.6% (95% CI: 12.6%-22.5%)
- ≥3.0 mg/L: 13.4% (95% CI: 8.8%-18.0%)
- ≥4.0 mg/L: 9.7% (95% CI: 5.5%-14.0%)
- ≥5.0 mg/L: 6.4% (95% CI: 3.3%-9.6%)

**LDL-C threshold sensitivity.** RIR prevalence (using hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L) remained relatively stable across LDL-C thresholds among statin users:
- <55 mg/dL (n=213): 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0%-36.8%)
- <60 mg/dL (n=317): 25.7% (95% CI: 17.3%-34.1%)
- <65 mg/dL (n=434): 22.7% (95% CI: 16.8%-28.7%)
- <70 mg/dL (n=577): 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%)
- <80 mg/dL (n=914): 23.5% (95% CI: 18.7%-28.4%)
- <100 mg/dL (n=1,605): 20.7% (95% CI: 17.4%-24.0%)

The stability of prevalence estimates across LDL-C thresholds suggests that inflammatory risk persists regardless of how aggressively LDL-C is lowered.
