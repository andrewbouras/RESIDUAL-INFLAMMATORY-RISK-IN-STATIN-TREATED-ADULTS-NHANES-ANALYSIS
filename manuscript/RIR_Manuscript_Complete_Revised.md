# Prevalence and Correlates of Residual Inflammatory Risk Among Statin-Treated U.S. Adults Achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of NHANES 2005-2020

---

## CLINICAL PERSPECTIVES

**What Is Known**
- Clinical trials suggest 30-40% of statin-treated patients maintain hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite LDL-C goal attainment
- Anti-inflammatory therapies (colchicine, canakinumab) reduce cardiovascular events in patients with residual inflammatory risk
- No nationally representative U.S. estimates of residual inflammatory risk prevalence exist

**What Is New**
- Among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL, 21.9% have residual inflammatory risk (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L)
- Diabetics show nearly double the RIR prevalence compared to those with normal glycemia
- BMI was associated with RIR in women but not men in exploratory sex-specific models, suggesting potential sex-specific inflammatory pathways that require confirmation

**Clinical Implications**
- These findings support consideration of hs-CRP measurement in statin-treated patients who have achieved lipid goals
- Diabetics with well-controlled LDL-C may particularly benefit from inflammatory risk assessment
- These findings raise the possibility that sex-specific approaches to inflammatory risk stratification could be informative and warrant further study

## ABSTRACT

**BACKGROUND** Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular events, yet a substantial proportion of statin-treated patients maintain elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) despite achieving LDL-C goals. Nationally representative estimates of this residual inflammatory risk (RIR) phenotype in the U.S. population are lacking.

**OBJECTIVES** To estimate the survey-weighted prevalence of RIR among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and to characterize associations with glycemic status and sex in exploratory analyses.

**METHODS** Cross-sectional analysis of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles 2005-2010 and 2015-2020. Adults aged ≥20 years with fasting lipid measurements and hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included. RIR was defined as concurrent statin use, LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. Survey-weighted prevalence estimates and logistic regression were performed accounting for complex survey design.

**RESULTS** Among 12,896 fasting adults, 2,527 reported statin use (weighted prevalence 19.6%), of whom 577 achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL. The survey-weighted RIR prevalence was 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%). In pre-specified exploratory analyses, statin users had higher hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier. RIR prevalence was higher among participants with diabetes (26.2%) compared to those with normal glycemia (15.3%; standard error [SE] 9.3%, reflecting imprecision in the normal glycemia subgroup). In sex-specific models, body mass index (BMI) predicted RIR in women (odds ratio [OR] 1.07 per kg/m², P=0.02) but not men.

**CONCLUSIONS** Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk. These nationally representative estimates provide a foundation for prevention planning and suggest that hs-CRP screening may help identify candidates for adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy evaluation in future outcome studies, particularly among patients with diabetes and well-controlled LDL-C.

## INTRODUCTION

Statins remain the cornerstone of pharmacotherapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention, reducing major cardiovascular events by 20-30% through low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering.^1^ Current guidelines recommend intensive statin therapy with LDL-C targets <70 mg/dL for patients with clinical ASCVD or very high-risk primary prevention.^2^ Despite widespread statin use and improved lipid control at the population level, substantial residual cardiovascular risk persists,^3^ prompting investigation of non-lipid pathways contributing to atherosclerosis progression.

Systemic inflammation, quantified by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), has emerged as a predictor of cardiovascular events independent of LDL-C.^4,5^ The concept of "residual inflammatory risk"—persistent hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy and lipid goal attainment—has gained clinical relevance following landmark trials demonstrating benefits of anti-inflammatory therapies. The CANTOS trial showed that interleukin-1β inhibition with canakinumab reduced cardiovascular events in patients with prior myocardial infarction and hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy,^6^ establishing a causal role for inflammation in atherosclerosis. Subsequently, the COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trials demonstrated that low-dose colchicine reduces cardiovascular events in patients with established coronary artery disease,^7,8^ providing a practical, widely available anti-inflammatory approach now endorsed by clinical guidelines.^9^

Post-hoc analyses from high-intensity statin trials suggest that 30-40% of treated patients maintain hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite achieving LDL-C goals.^10^ However, these estimates derive from clinical trial populations with enriched cardiovascular risk. Nationally representative estimates of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated individuals in the general U.S. population are lacking. Such estimates are essential for understanding the population-level burden of on-treatment inflammation, identifying candidates for adjunctive therapy, and characterizing high-risk subgroups. The American Heart Association's cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health framework further emphasizes the bidirectional relationship between metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation.^11^

We therefore analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate the weighted prevalence of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL. In pre-specified exploratory analyses, we examined hs-CRP elevation across the spectrum of LDL-C levels and statin use, evaluated associations with glycemic status and sex, and identified demographic and clinical correlates of residual inflammatory risk.

## METHODS

### DATA SOURCE AND STUDY POPULATION

This analysis utilized publicly available data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).^12^ NHANES employs a complex, multistage probability sampling design with oversampling of certain demographic groups to produce reliable subpopulation estimates.

Five survey cycles were included: 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020 (pre-pandemic). Cycles 2011-2014 were excluded due to limitations in harmonizing hs-CRP laboratory data across the analytic pipeline. The 2017-2020 cycle combined pre-pandemic data from 2017-2018 and 2019-March 2020 per NCHS analytic guidance.

Participants were eligible if they: (1) were aged ≥20 years; (2) attended the mobile examination center and provided a fasting blood sample (required for LDL-C calculation); (3) had measured hs-CRP; and (4) had prescription medication data available for statin ascertainment. Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L were excluded to remove acute inflammation likely reflecting infectious or transient inflammatory processes rather than chronic cardiovascular risk.^13^

### VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

**Statin use.** Current statin use was ascertained from NHANES prescription medication interview files (RXQ_RX). Participants were classified as statin users if they reported taking any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in the past 30 days, identified through generic drug name matching (atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin) and Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification code 358.

**Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.** LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation: LDL-C = total cholesterol − HDL-C − (triglycerides/5), expressed in mg/dL.^14^ Calculations were restricted to participants with triglycerides <400 mg/dL, above which the Friedewald equation becomes unreliable.

**High-sensitivity C-reactive protein.** hs-CRP was measured in serum using latex-enhanced nephelometry.^15^ The threshold of ≥2 mg/L was used to define elevated inflammatory risk based on established cardiovascular risk stratification guidelines.^16^

**Diabetes.** Diabetes was defined as: HbA1c ≥6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, self-reported physician diagnosis, or current use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, consistent with American Diabetes Association criteria.^17^

**Prediabetes.** Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL in the absence of diabetes.^17^

**Glycemic status.** Participants were categorized into mutually exclusive groups: diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glycemia.

**Hypertension.** Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg (mean of up to three measurements), or self-reported current use of antihypertensive medication.^18^

**Obesity.** Body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², calculated from measured height and weight.

**Smoking status.** Current smoking was defined as self-report of ≥100 lifetime cigarettes and currently smoking every day or some days.

**Race and ethnicity.** Self-reported race and Hispanic origin were combined into five categories per NHANES public-use file classifications: Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, and Other/Multi-racial.

### OUTCOMES

**Primary outcome.** Residual inflammatory risk (RIR) was defined as the co-occurrence of: (1) current statin use, (2) LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and (3) hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L.

**Sensitivity analyses.** Alternative hs-CRP thresholds (≥1.5, ≥2.5, ≥3, ≥4, ≥5 mg/L) and LDL-C thresholds (<55, <60, <65, <80, <100 mg/dL) were examined.

### STRATIFICATION VARIABLES

**LDL-C and statin status.** Participants were cross-classified into six groups based on LDL-C (≤70, 70-130, >130 mg/dL) and statin use (user, non-user).

**Glycemic status.** Normal, prediabetes, diabetes.

**Sex.** Male, female (self-reported).

### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All analyses incorporated NHANES complex survey design elements: primary sampling units (SDMVPSU), strata (SDMVSTRA), and sampling weights.^12^ Fasting subsample weights (WTSAF2YR for 2005-2016; WTSAFPRP for 2017-2020) were used and divided by the number of cycles (n=5) to appropriately combine data across cycles. The lonely primary sampling unit adjustment was applied.

**Primary analysis.** Survey-weighted prevalence of RIR was estimated among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using Taylor series linearization.

**Exploratory analyses.** The following were pre-specified as exploratory and hypothesis-generating: (1) hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence across six LDL×statin groups; (2) RIR prevalence by glycemic status; (3) sex-stratified prevalence and predictors. These analyses were not powered for formal interaction testing.

**Regression analysis.** Survey-weighted logistic regression identified correlates of RIR. Covariates included age (continuous), sex, race/ethnicity, BMI (continuous), diabetes (binary), hypertension (binary), current smoking (binary), and triglycerides (continuous). A parsimonious model was used given the sample size constraints.

**Characteristics comparison.** Survey-weighted means (continuous variables) and proportions (categorical variables) were compared between RIR and non-RIR groups using survey-adjusted t-tests and design-based chi-square tests, respectively.

**Missing data.** Analyses used complete cases for each variable. The proportion of missing data for key variables is reported in Supplemental Table 1.

**Power considerations.** The primary cohort included 577 statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL and 141 RIR cases. With approximately 24% RIR prevalence, this sample provides 80% power to detect odds ratios ≥1.5 for predictors with moderate prevalence (30-50%). Regression analyses are underpowered for smaller effect sizes.

**Software.** Analyses were performed using R version 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the survey package version 4.2.^19^ Two-sided P<0.05 defined statistical significance.

### ETHICAL STATEMENT

NHANES protocols were approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent. This secondary analysis of publicly available, de-identified data is exempt from institutional review board review per 45 CFR 46.104(d)(4).

## RESULTS

### STUDY POPULATION

From NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, 12,896 fasting adults aged ≥20 years with hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included (Figure S1, patient flow diagram). The survey-weighted prevalence of statin use was 19.6% (n=2,527 unweighted). Among statin users, 577 (unweighted) achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, representing the primary analytic cohort. Of these, 141 participants met RIR criteria.

Baseline characteristics by RIR status are shown in **Table 1**. Mean age was similar between groups (No RIR: 66.2 years; RIR: 65.4 years; P=0.64). Participants with RIR had significantly higher BMI (32.4 vs 29.8 kg/m², P=0.039), higher HbA1c (6.9% vs 6.2%, P=0.032), and more prevalent hypertension (87.9% vs 76.8%, P=0.042). By definition, hs-CRP was markedly higher in the RIR group (4.1 vs 0.6 mg/L, P<0.001). Diabetes prevalence was numerically higher in the RIR group (64.6% vs 51.1%) but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.19), likely reflecting limited power for this comparison.

### PRIMARY OUTCOME

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (n=577), the survey-weighted prevalence of RIR was **21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%)**. Using the more stringent hs-CRP ≥3 mg/L threshold, RIR prevalence was 13.4% (95% CI: 8.8%-18.0%).

Among the subset achieving LDL-C <55 mg/dL (n=213), RIR prevalence was 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0%-36.8%), indicating that elevated inflammatory burden persists even with more aggressive lipid lowering.

### EXPLORATORY: 6-GROUP LDL×STATIN ANALYSIS

hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence was examined across six LDL×statin groups (**Table 2**, **Figure 1**). Within each LDL-C tier, statin users had higher hs-CRP prevalence than non-users:

| LDL-C Category | Statin Users | Non-Users | Difference |
|----------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| ≤70 mg/dL | 22.4% (SE 3.0%) | 14.5% (SE 2.0%) | +7.9 pp |
| 70-130 mg/dL | 20.1% (SE 1.8%) | 17.7% (SE 0.8%) | +2.4 pp |
| >130 mg/dL | 27.0% (SE 4.6%) | 19.8% (SE 1.3%) | +7.2 pp |

Abbreviation: pp, percentage points.

Of note, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L, representing individuals with low LDL-C and elevated inflammation without statin exposure. This pattern may reflect underlying metabolic-inflammatory status rather than a distinct clinical phenotype and warrants investigation in longitudinal studies.

### EXPLORATORY: GLYCEMIC STATUS

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, RIR prevalence increased across glycemic categories (**Table 2**, **Figure 2**):

| Glycemic Status | n | RIR Prevalence | SE |
|-----------------|---|----------------|-----|
| Normal | 47 | 15.3% | 9.3%* |
| Prediabetes | 180 | 17.4% | 5.2% |
| Diabetes | 350 | 26.2% | 4.8% |

*Note: The normal glycemia estimate has high imprecision due to small sample size.

This gradient was consistent across all six LDL×statin groups (Table 2B), with diabetics showing highest hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence regardless of LDL-C tier or statin status.

### EXPLORATORY: SEX DIFFERENCES

Women showed higher hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence than men in most subgroups (**Table 2C**, **Figure 3**):

- LDL ≤70, no statin: Women 18.3% vs Men 9.7% (difference: 8.6 pp)
- LDL >130, statin: Women 32.0% vs Men 20.4% (difference: 11.6 pp)

In sex-specific regression models among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, BMI was a significant predictor of RIR in women (OR 1.07 per kg/m², 95% CI: 1.01-1.14, P=0.02) but not in men (OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.93-1.14, P=0.59). Age was also significant in women (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI: 1.00-1.08, P=0.04) but not men.

### PREDICTORS OF RIR

In survey-weighted logistic regression for the full primary cohort (**Table 3**), no individual predictor achieved P<0.05. BMI showed a trend (OR 1.05 per kg/m², 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, P=0.055). Elevated point estimates were observed for diabetes (OR 1.64, 95% CI: 0.73-3.67), hypertension (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 0.82-4.71), and current smoking (OR 1.96, 95% CI: 0.74-5.19), but confidence intervals included 1.0. These null findings likely reflect limited statistical power rather than absence of association.

### SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

RIR prevalence exhibited a dose-response relationship across hs-CRP thresholds (**Supplemental Table 2**): 29.6% at ≥1.5 mg/L, decreasing to 6.4% at ≥5.0 mg/L. Across LDL-C thresholds, prevalence remained stable (range: 20.7%-26.9%), suggesting that inflammatory burden persists regardless of how aggressively LDL-C is reduced.

## DISCUSSION

In this nationally representative analysis of U.S. adults, approximately one in five statin-treated individuals achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL had residual inflammatory risk, defined as hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite lipid goal attainment. This estimate provides population-level quantification of on-treatment inflammation among patients meeting guideline-recommended lipid targets and is consistent with—though somewhat lower than—estimates from clinical trial populations with enriched cardiovascular risk.^10^

The observation that statin users had higher hs-CRP prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier warrants careful interpretation. This pattern likely reflects confounding by indication: patients prescribed statins have higher underlying cardiovascular risk, more comorbidities (including conditions driving inflammation), and fundamentally differ from non-users with similar LDL-C levels. The cross-sectional design cannot distinguish whether statins fail to fully suppress inflammation or whether statin-treated patients have intrinsically higher inflammatory burden. Importantly, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had elevated hs-CRP, suggesting that metabolic-inflammatory phenotypes exist independent of statin exposure. This observation requires validation in prospective cohorts before being characterized as a distinct clinical entity.

The association between worsening glycemic status and higher RIR prevalence aligns with the American Heart Association's CKM health framework emphasizing metabolic-inflammatory interconnections.^11^ Diabetics had RIR prevalence approximately 70% higher than those with normal glycemia (26.2% vs 15.3%), though the latter estimate is imprecise. This finding has therapeutic relevance: GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, which have both glycemic and anti-inflammatory properties, may offer particular benefit in patients with coexistent diabetes and elevated inflammatory markers.^20,21^ The consistency of this gradient across all LDL×statin groups suggests that the diabetes-inflammation association is independent of lipid status.

Sex differences in inflammatory burden are well-established,^22^ and our findings extend this to the lipid-lowering context. Women showed higher hs-CRP prevalence across most subgroups, and BMI predicted RIR in women but not men. This sex-specific adiposity-inflammation relationship may reflect differences in adipose tissue distribution, hormonal milieu, or immune function. These observations support consideration of sex-specific thresholds or approaches to inflammatory risk assessment, though prospective outcome data are needed before modifying clinical practice.

From a clinical standpoint, these findings support consideration of hs-CRP measurement in statin-treated patients who have achieved LDL-C goals. With colchicine now endorsed for secondary prevention in patients with established coronary artery disease,^9^ identification of residual inflammatory risk has potential therapeutic implications. The ~22% prevalence estimate suggests a substantial population that could be considered for adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy evaluation in future trials or guideline discussions, though clinical trials specifically enrolling patients based on post-statin hs-CRP elevation remain limited.

### LIMITATIONS

First, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference; we characterized prevalence but cannot link RIR to cardiovascular outcomes. Second, single hs-CRP measurement may misclassify individuals due to within-person variability; clinical guidelines recommend confirmation with repeat testing.^13^ Third, statin use was self-reported without verification of adherence or intensity. Fourth, NHANES cycles 2011-2014 were excluded due to limitations in harmonizing hs-CRP laboratory data. Fifth, the sample size (N=577, 141 events) limits regression power for detecting modest effect sizes. Sixth, exploratory analyses (LDL×statin, glycemic, sex strata) are hypothesis-generating and were not powered for formal interaction testing. Seventh, the normal glycemia subgroup estimate has high imprecision (SE 9.3%). Finally, residual confounding from unmeasured variables (e.g., inflammatory conditions, medication adherence) cannot be excluded.

### FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Prospective studies linking RIR to cardiovascular outcomes in population-based cohorts would establish the clinical significance of this phenotype. Evaluation of anti-inflammatory therapy efficacy stratified by baseline hs-CRP in patients already achieving LDL-C goals is warranted. Additionally, investigation of whether the sex-specific BMI-inflammation relationship translates to differential outcomes could inform precision prevention strategies.

### CONCLUSIONS

Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk defined by hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. In exploratory analyses, RIR prevalence was higher among diabetics and showed sex-specific patterns, with BMI predicting RIR in women but not men. These nationally representative estimates quantify the burden of on-treatment inflammation and support consideration of hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C, particularly those with diabetes.
