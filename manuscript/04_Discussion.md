# DISCUSSION

In this nationally representative analysis of U.S. adults, we found that approximately one in five statin-treated individuals achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk, defined as hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite lipid goal attainment. This finding quantifies for the first time the population-level burden of on-treatment inflammation among patients who have achieved guideline-recommended lipid targets. The ~22% prevalence is consistent with estimates derived from clinical trial populations and underscores that inflammation persists as a therapeutic target even among patients with excellent lipid control.^1^

Our exploratory 6-group analysis stratifying participants by LDL-C level and statin use revealed that statin users consistently had higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier. This observation may reflect confounding by indication—patients prescribed statins are inherently at higher cardiovascular risk and may have greater underlying inflammatory burden than the general population with similar LDL-C levels. Alternatively, this pattern may suggest that statin-mediated LDL-C lowering does not fully address the inflammatory component of atherosclerotic risk. Notably, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had elevated hs-CRP, representing individuals with naturally low LDL-C who maintain systemic inflammation. This pattern may reflect underlying metabolic-inflammatory status rather than a distinct clinical phenotype and requires confirmation in longitudinal studies.

The association between glycemic status and residual inflammatory risk aligns with the American Heart Association's cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health framework, which emphasizes the bidirectional relationship between metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation.^2^ Diabetics in our cohort had nearly double the RIR prevalence (26.2%) compared to those with normal glycemia (15.3%), though the latter estimate has high imprecision due to limited sample size. This metabolic-inflammatory connection has important therapeutic implications. Agents with dual metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects—including GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors—may be particularly beneficial in patients with coexistent diabetes and elevated inflammatory markers.^3,4^ The persistence of this pattern across all LDL×statin groups suggests that the diabetes-inflammation association is independent of lipid status.

Sex differences in inflammatory burden have been well-documented, with women generally showing higher hs-CRP levels than men.^5^ Our findings extend this observation to the context of lipid-lowering therapy. Women showed higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than men among non-statin users across all LDL-C tiers, with particularly pronounced differences in the LDL>130 statin group (32.0% vs 20.4%). Sex-specific regression analyses revealed that BMI was a significant predictor of RIR in women (OR 1.07 per kg/m²) but not in men, suggesting that adiposity-related inflammation may be more relevant to cardiovascular risk in women. These findings support consideration of sex-specific approaches to inflammatory risk assessment.

From a clinical perspective, our findings support the utility of hs-CRP measurement in statin-treated patients who have achieved LDL-C goals. Current guidelines recommend consideration of hs-CRP for risk refinement in intermediate-risk patients, but do not specifically address on-treatment assessment.^6^ Our data suggest that approximately one-fifth of patients achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL remain candidates for additional risk reduction based on inflammatory markers. With the availability of colchicine as an adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy for patients with coronary artery disease, identification of residual inflammatory risk has direct therapeutic implications.^7,8^

Our prevalence estimates are consistent with data from statin trials. In the FOURIER trial, which enrolled patients with ASCVD on high-intensity statin therapy, approximately 47% had hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L at baseline.^9^ In CANTOS, eligibility required hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy, reflecting the substantial pool of patients with residual inflammatory risk.^10^ Our population-based estimate of 22% among those achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL aligns with these trial observations and confirms that this phenotype is common in routine clinical practice.

## LIMITATIONS

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference; we can characterize prevalence but cannot determine whether residual inflammatory risk leads to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in this population. Second, hs-CRP was measured at a single time point, and within-person variability may lead to misclassification of some individuals. Serial measurements, as recommended in clinical practice, would provide more reliable classification.^11^ Third, statin use was based on self-report, and medication adherence was not directly assessed. Fourth, cycles 2011-2014 were not incorporated due to incomplete availability of harmonized hs-CRP files for those years; their inclusion is planned as a robustness check. Fifth, regression analyses are limited by sample size (N=577 with 141 RIR events) and are underpowered for detecting small effect sizes. Sixth, the exploratory analyses (LDL×statin groups, glycemic strata, sex strata) are hypothesis-generating and were not powered for formal interaction testing. Seventh, prevalence estimates in the normal glycemia subgroup have high imprecision (SE 9.3%) due to limited sample size. Finally, the cross-sectional design does not allow direct linkage of RIR to cardiovascular events; prospective studies with outcomes data are needed to confirm the clinical significance of this phenotype.

## CONCLUSIONS

Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk defined by hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. In exploratory analyses, RIR prevalence was higher among diabetics and showed sex-specific patterns, with BMI predicting RIR in women but not men. These nationally representative estimates quantify the burden of on-treatment inflammation and support targeted hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C, particularly those with diabetes. Prospective studies are needed to determine optimal management strategies for this high-risk population.
