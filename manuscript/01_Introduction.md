# INTRODUCTION

Statins remain the cornerstone of pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention, reducing cardiovascular events by 20-30% through LDL-cholesterol lowering.^1^ Current guidelines recommend intensive statin therapy with LDL-C targets <70 mg/dL for patients with established ASCVD or very high-risk primary prevention.^2^ Despite widespread statin use and improved lipid control, substantial residual cardiovascular risk persists, prompting investigation of non-lipid pathways contributing to atherosclerotic disease progression.^3^

Systemic inflammation, as measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), has emerged as a robust predictor of cardiovascular events independent of LDL-C.^4,5^ The concept of "residual inflammatory risk"—defined as persistent elevation of hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy and lipid goal attainment—has gained particular attention following results from landmark trials. CANTOS demonstrated that targeting interleukin-1β with canakinumab reduced cardiovascular events in patients with hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy, establishing causality of the inflammatory pathway in atherosclerosis.^6^ Subsequently, the COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trials showed that low-dose colchicine reduces cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, providing a practical anti-inflammatory approach.^7,8^

Post-hoc analyses from statin trials suggest that 30-40% of patients treated with high-intensity statins maintain hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite achieving LDL-C goals.^9^ However, nationally representative estimates of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated individuals in the general U.S. population are lacking. Understanding the population-level burden of this inflammatory phenotype is essential for prevention planning, identifying candidates for adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, and characterizing high-risk subgroups who may benefit from intensified management. The American Heart Association's cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health framework further emphasizes the interconnection between metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and cardiovascular risk.^10^

We therefore sought to estimate the weighted prevalence of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Secondary objectives included characterizing hs-CRP elevation across the spectrum of LDL-C levels and statin use, examining associations with glycemic status and sex, and identifying demographic and clinical predictors of residual inflammatory risk.
