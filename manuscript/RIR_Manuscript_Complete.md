# Prevalence and Correlates of Residual Inflammatory Risk Among Statin-Treated U.S. Adults Achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL: A Cross-Sectional NHANES Analysis

---

## ABSTRACT

**BACKGROUND** Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events, but a substantial proportion of statin-treated patients maintain elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) despite achieving LDL-C goals. Nationally representative estimates of this "residual inflammatory risk" (RIR) are lacking.

**OBJECTIVES** To estimate the weighted prevalence of RIR among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL and characterize hs-CRP elevation across LDL-C tiers, glycemic status, and sex.

**METHODS** Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2020 (5 cycles). Fasting adults aged ≥20 years with hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included. RIR was defined as statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. Primary analysis estimated survey-weighted RIR prevalence. Exploratory analyses examined hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence across 6 LDL×statin groups and by glycemic status and sex. Survey-weighted logistic regression identified RIR predictors.

**RESULTS** Among 12,896 fasting adults, 2,527 (19.6%) were statin users, of whom 577 achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL. RIR prevalence was 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%). In exploratory analyses, statin users had higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier. Diabetics had higher RIR prevalence (26.2%) than those with normal glycemia (15.3%, SE 9.3%). Women showed higher hs-CRP burden than men in non-statin groups. In sex-specific models, BMI predicted RIR in women (OR 1.07, p=0.02) but not men.

**CONCLUSIONS** Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk. In exploratory analyses, RIR was more prevalent in diabetics and showed sex-specific patterns. These findings support targeted hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C.

## INTRODUCTION

Statins remain the cornerstone of pharmacologic therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention, reducing cardiovascular events by 20-30% through LDL-cholesterol lowering.^1^ Current guidelines recommend intensive statin therapy with LDL-C targets <70 mg/dL for patients with established ASCVD or very high-risk primary prevention.^2^ Despite widespread statin use and improved lipid control, substantial residual cardiovascular risk persists, prompting investigation of non-lipid pathways contributing to atherosclerotic disease progression.^3^

Systemic inflammation, as measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), has emerged as a robust predictor of cardiovascular events independent of LDL-C.^4,5^ The concept of "residual inflammatory risk"—defined as persistent elevation of hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy and lipid goal attainment—has gained particular attention following results from landmark trials. CANTOS demonstrated that targeting interleukin-1β with canakinumab reduced cardiovascular events in patients with hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite statin therapy, establishing causality of the inflammatory pathway in atherosclerosis.^6^ Subsequently, the COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trials showed that low-dose colchicine reduces cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, providing a practical anti-inflammatory approach.^7,8^

Post-hoc analyses from statin trials suggest that 30-40% of patients treated with high-intensity statins maintain hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite achieving LDL-C goals.^9^ However, nationally representative estimates of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated individuals in the general U.S. population are lacking. Understanding the population-level burden of this inflammatory phenotype is essential for prevention planning, identifying candidates for adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy, and characterizing high-risk subgroups who may benefit from intensified management. The American Heart Association's cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) health framework further emphasizes the interconnection between metabolic dysfunction, chronic inflammation, and cardiovascular risk.^10^

We therefore sought to estimate the weighted prevalence of residual inflammatory risk among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Secondary objectives included characterizing hs-CRP elevation across the spectrum of LDL-C levels and statin use, examining associations with glycemic status and sex, and identifying demographic and clinical predictors of residual inflammatory risk.

## METHODS

### DATA SOURCE AND STUDY POPULATION

This analysis utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics.^11^ NHANES employs a complex, multistage probability sampling design with oversampling of certain demographic groups to produce reliable estimates for these subpopulations.

Data from five survey cycles were included: 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2015-2016, and 2017-2020 (pre-pandemic). Cycles 2011-2014 were not incorporated due to incomplete availability of harmonized high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) files for those years; their inclusion is planned as a robustness check in future analyses. The 2017-2020 cycle combined data from 2017-2018 and 2019-March 2020 (pre-pandemic portion only) per NCHS guidelines.

Participants were eligible if they were aged ≥20 years, had fasting lipid measurements (required for LDL-C calculation), had measured hs-CRP, and had prescription medication data available for statin use ascertainment. Participants with hs-CRP >10 mg/L were excluded to remove acute inflammation that may reflect transient infectious or inflammatory processes rather than chronic cardiovascular risk.^12^

### VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

**Statin use.** Current statin use was identified from NHANES prescription medication files (RXQ_RX). Participants were classified as statin users if they reported taking any of the following medications in the past 30 days: atorvastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, or pitavastatin. Medications were identified by generic drug name matching and confirmed using the Multum Lexicon therapeutic classification code 358 (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors).

**Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).** LDL-C was calculated using the Friedewald equation: LDL-C = total cholesterol − HDL-C − (triglycerides/5), expressed in mg/dL.^13^ Calculations were restricted to participants with triglycerides <400 mg/dL, as the Friedewald equation becomes unreliable at higher triglyceride levels.

**High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).** hs-CRP was measured in serum using latex-enhanced nephelometry at NHANES mobile examination centers.^14^ Values are expressed in mg/L. hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L was used as the primary threshold for elevated inflammatory risk based on established cardiovascular risk stratification guidelines.^15^

**Diabetes.** Diabetes was defined as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, or current use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications.^16^

**Prediabetes.** Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c 5.7-6.4% or fasting plasma glucose 100-125 mg/dL in the absence of diabetes.^16^

**Hypertension.** Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥130 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥80 mm Hg, or self-reported current use of antihypertensive medication.^17^

**Obesity.** Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m², calculated from measured weight and height.

**Current smoking.** Current smoking was defined as having smoked ≥100 cigarettes in lifetime and currently smoking cigarettes every day or some days.

### OUTCOMES

**Primary outcome.** Residual inflammatory risk (RIR) was defined as the co-occurrence of: (1) current statin use, (2) LDL-C <70 mg/dL, and (3) hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L.

**Sensitivity definitions.** Sensitivity analyses were conducted using alternative hs-CRP thresholds (≥1.5, ≥2.5, ≥3, ≥4, ≥5 mg/L) and alternative LDL-C thresholds (<55, <60, <65, <80, <100 mg/dL).

### STRATIFICATION VARIABLES

**LDL-C and statin status (6 groups).** Participants were cross-classified into six mutually exclusive groups based on LDL-C category (≤70, 70-130, >130 mg/dL) and statin use status (user, non-user).

**Glycemic status.** Normal glycemia, prediabetes, and diabetes.

**Sex.** Male and female, based on self-reported sex.

### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

All analyses incorporated NHANES complex survey design elements including primary sampling units (SDMVPSU), strata (SDMVSTRA), and sampling weights.^11^ Fasting subsample weights (WTSAF2YR for cycles 2005-2016; WTSAFPRP for 2017-2020) were used and divided by the number of study cycles (n=5) per NCHS guidelines.

**Primary analysis.** Survey-weighted prevalence of RIR was estimated among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL with 95% confidence intervals. Survey-weighted logistic regression was used to identify demographic and clinical predictors of RIR.

**Exploratory analyses.** The following analyses were pre-specified as exploratory: (1) survey-weighted prevalence of hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L across the six LDL×statin groups; (2) RIR prevalence stratified by glycemic status; (3) sex-stratified prevalence and predictors. These exploratory analyses are hypothesis-generating and were not powered for formal interaction testing.

**Power considerations.** The primary analytic cohort included 577 statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, of whom 141 met RIR criteria. Regression analyses are limited by this sample size and are underpowered for detecting small effect sizes.

All analyses were performed using R version 4.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The survey package was used for survey-weighted analyses.^18^

### ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

NHANES protocols were approved by the NCHS Research Ethics Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent. This secondary analysis of publicly available, de-identified data is exempt from institutional review board review per 45 CFR 46.104.

## RESULTS

### STUDY POPULATION

From NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, a total of 12,896 fasting adults aged ≥20 years with hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included in the analysis. Among these, 2,527 (19.6% weighted) reported current statin use. Of the statin users, 577 (22.8% of statin users) had achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL, representing the primary analytic cohort. Within this cohort, 141 participants met criteria for residual inflammatory risk.

Baseline characteristics stratified by RIR status are presented in **Table 1**. The mean age was similar between groups (66.2 vs 65.4 years, p=0.64). Participants with RIR had significantly higher BMI (32.4 vs 29.8 kg/m², p=0.039), higher HbA1c (6.9% vs 6.2%, p=0.032), and higher prevalence of hypertension (87.9% vs 76.8%, p=0.042). Diabetes prevalence was numerically higher in the RIR group (64.6% vs 51.1%) but did not reach statistical significance (p=0.19).

### PRIMARY OUTCOME: RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK PREVALENCE

Among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (n=577), the survey-weighted prevalence of RIR (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L) was **21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%)**. Using the more stringent hs-CRP threshold of ≥3 mg/L, RIR prevalence was 13.4% (95% CI: 8.8%-18.0%).

Among the subset of statin users achieving the more aggressive LDL-C target of <55 mg/dL (n=213), RIR prevalence was higher at 26.9% (95% CI: 17.0%-36.8%), suggesting that even patients achieving very low LDL-C levels maintain substantial inflammatory burden.

### EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: 6-GROUP LDL×STATIN STRATIFICATION

hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence was examined across six mutually exclusive LDL×statin groups (**Table 2**, **Figure 1**). Within each LDL-C tier, statin users consistently showed higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users:

- **LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL:** Statin users 22.4% (SE 3.0%) vs non-users 14.5% (SE 2.0%)
- **LDL-C 70-130 mg/dL:** Statin users 20.1% (SE 1.8%) vs non-users 17.7% (SE 0.8%)
- **LDL-C >130 mg/dL:** Statin users 27.0% (SE 4.6%) vs non-users 19.8% (SE 1.3%)

Notably, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L, representing individuals with low LDL-C and elevated inflammation in the absence of statin therapy.

### EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: GLYCEMIC STATUS STRATIFICATION

RIR prevalence was examined by glycemic status among statin users with LDL-C <70 mg/dL (**Figure 2**):

- **Normal glycemia (n=47):** 15.3% (SE 9.3%) — *Note: high imprecision due to limited sample size*
- **Prediabetes (n=180):** 17.4% (SE 5.2%)
- **Diabetes (n=350):** 26.2% (SE 4.8%)

The pattern of increasing RIR prevalence with worsening glycemic status was consistent across all six LDL×statin groups.

### EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: SEX DIFFERENCES

Sex-stratified analysis revealed higher inflammatory burden in women among non-statin users (**Figure 3**):

- **LDL ≤70, no statin:** Females 18.3% (SE 2.7%) vs Males 9.7% (SE 2.0%)
- **LDL >130, statin:** Females 32.0% (SE 5.9%) vs Males 20.4% (SE 4.9%)

In sex-specific regression models, BMI (OR 1.07 per kg/m², p=0.02) and age (OR 1.04 per year, p=0.04) were significant predictors of RIR in women. Neither predictor was significant in men.

### PREDICTORS OF RESIDUAL INFLAMMATORY RISK

In the full cohort, survey-weighted logistic regression identified no individual predictor achieving p<0.05 (**Table 3**). BMI showed a trend toward higher odds of RIR (OR 1.05 per kg/m², 95% CI: 1.00-1.11, p=0.055). Diabetes (OR 1.64), hypertension (OR 1.96), and current smoking (OR 1.96) showed elevated point estimates but did not reach statistical significance.

### SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of the primary findings. RIR prevalence showed a clear dose-response pattern across hs-CRP thresholds: 29.6% (≥1.5 mg/L), 21.9% (≥2.0 mg/L), 17.6% (≥2.5 mg/L), 13.4% (≥3.0 mg/L), 9.7% (≥4.0 mg/L), and 6.4% (≥5.0 mg/L). RIR prevalence remained relatively stable across LDL-C thresholds (20.7%-26.9%), suggesting inflammatory risk persists regardless of how aggressively LDL-C is lowered.

## DISCUSSION

In this nationally representative analysis of U.S. adults, we found that approximately one in five statin-treated individuals achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk, defined as hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L despite lipid goal attainment. This finding quantifies for the first time the population-level burden of on-treatment inflammation among patients who have achieved guideline-recommended lipid targets. The ~22% prevalence is consistent with estimates derived from clinical trial populations and underscores that inflammation persists as a therapeutic target even among patients with excellent lipid control.^9^

Our exploratory 6-group analysis revealed that statin users consistently had higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier. This observation may reflect confounding by indication—patients prescribed statins are inherently at higher cardiovascular risk and may have greater underlying inflammatory burden. Alternatively, this pattern may suggest that statin-mediated LDL-C lowering does not fully address the inflammatory component of atherosclerotic risk. Notably, 14.5% of non-statin users with LDL-C ≤70 mg/dL had elevated hs-CRP. This pattern may reflect underlying metabolic-inflammatory status rather than a distinct clinical phenotype and requires confirmation in longitudinal studies.

The association between glycemic status and residual inflammatory risk aligns with the American Heart Association's CKM health framework, which emphasizes the bidirectional relationship between metabolic dysfunction and chronic inflammation.^10^ Diabetics in our cohort had nearly double the RIR prevalence (26.2%) compared to those with normal glycemia (15.3%). This metabolic-inflammatory connection has important therapeutic implications. Agents with dual metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects—including GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors—may be particularly beneficial in patients with coexistent diabetes and elevated inflammatory markers.^19,20^

Sex differences in inflammatory burden have been well-documented.^21^ Our findings extend this observation to the context of lipid-lowering therapy. Women showed higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than men among non-statin users across all LDL-C tiers. Sex-specific regression analyses revealed that BMI was a significant predictor of RIR in women (OR 1.07 per kg/m²) but not in men, suggesting that adiposity-related inflammation may be more relevant to cardiovascular risk in women.

From a clinical perspective, our findings support the utility of hs-CRP measurement in statin-treated patients who have achieved LDL-C goals. With the availability of colchicine as an adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy for patients with coronary artery disease, identification of residual inflammatory risk has direct therapeutic implications.^7,8^

### LIMITATIONS

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, the cross-sectional design precludes causal inference. Second, hs-CRP was measured at a single time point, and within-person variability may lead to misclassification. Third, statin use was based on self-report, and medication adherence was not directly assessed. Fourth, cycles 2011-2014 were not incorporated due to incomplete availability of harmonized hs-CRP files; their inclusion is planned as a robustness check. Fifth, regression analyses are limited by sample size (N=577 with 141 RIR events) and are underpowered for detecting small effect sizes. Sixth, the exploratory analyses are hypothesis-generating and were not powered for formal interaction testing. Seventh, prevalence estimates in the normal glycemia subgroup have high imprecision (SE 9.3%).

### CONCLUSIONS

Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk defined by hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. In exploratory analyses, RIR prevalence was higher among diabetics and showed sex-specific patterns, with BMI predicting RIR in women but not men. These nationally representative estimates quantify the burden of on-treatment inflammation and support targeted hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C, particularly those with diabetes.
