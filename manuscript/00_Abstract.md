# Prevalence and Correlates of Residual Inflammatory Risk Among Statin-Treated U.S. Adults Achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL: A Cross-Sectional NHANES Analysis

---

## ABSTRACT

**BACKGROUND** Statins reduce LDL cholesterol and cardiovascular events, but a substantial proportion of statin-treated patients maintain elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) despite achieving LDL-C goals. Nationally representative estimates of this "residual inflammatory risk" (RIR) are lacking.

**OBJECTIVES** To estimate the weighted prevalence of RIR among statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL and characterize hs-CRP elevation across LDL-C tiers, glycemic status, and sex.

**METHODS** Cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-2010 and 2015-2020 (5 cycles). Fasting adults aged ≥20 years with hs-CRP ≤10 mg/L were included. RIR was defined as statin use + LDL-C <70 mg/dL + hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L. Primary analysis estimated survey-weighted RIR prevalence. Exploratory analyses examined hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L prevalence across 6 LDL×statin groups and by glycemic status and sex. Survey-weighted logistic regression identified RIR predictors.

**RESULTS** Among 12,896 fasting adults, 2,527 (19.6%) were statin users, of whom 577 achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL. RIR prevalence was 21.9% (95% CI: 15.9%-27.9%). In exploratory analyses, statin users had higher hs-CRP ≥2 prevalence than non-users within each LDL-C tier. Diabetics had higher RIR prevalence (26.2%) than those with normal glycemia (15.3%, SE 9.3%). Women showed higher hs-CRP burden than men in non-statin groups. In sex-specific models, BMI predicted RIR in women (OR 1.07, p=0.02) but not men.

**CONCLUSIONS** Approximately one in five statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL has residual inflammatory risk. In exploratory analyses, RIR was more prevalent in diabetics and showed sex-specific patterns. These findings support targeted hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C.

## CONDENSED ABSTRACT (for visual abstract/social media)

Among 577 statin-treated U.S. adults with LDL-C <70 mg/dL, 22% had residual inflammatory risk (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L). Inflammatory burden was highest in diabetics (26%) and women, suggesting targeted hs-CRP screening may identify candidates for adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy.

## HIGHLIGHTS

• Approximately 22% of statin-treated U.S. adults achieving LDL-C <70 mg/dL have residual inflammatory risk (hs-CRP ≥2 mg/L)

• Statin users showed higher hs-CRP prevalence than non-users across all LDL-C tiers

• Diabetics had nearly double the RIR prevalence compared to those with normal glycemia

• BMI predicted RIR in women but not men, suggesting sex-specific inflammatory pathways

• Findings support hs-CRP screening in statin-treated patients with well-controlled LDL-C
